        <h3>Non-Linear Data Structure</h3>
        <ul class="list" style="font-size: 25px;">
            <li>The elements are stored in a hierarchical fashion.</li>
            <li>They are connected to each other using ‘nodes’.</li>
            <li>The elements of this structure are present at different levels, not a single level.</li>
            <li>Their implementation is not easy.</li>
            <li>They can’t be traversed easily- it requires multiple iterations to completely walk through a non-linear data structure.</li>
            <li>They are memory-friendly, i.e they use memory efficiently.</li>
            <li>The time complexity of a non-linear data structure remains same even when the size of the data increases.</li>
            <li>Examples include:Tree,Graph,Hashing</li>

        <h4 class="non-linear2">Tree</h4>
        <div class="list">
            A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does not store in a sequential manner. It is a hierarchical structure as elements in a Tree are arranged in multiple levels.

        <h4 class="non-linear2">Graph</h4>
        <div class="list">A graph can be defined as group of vertices and edges that are used to connect these vertices. A graph can be seen as a cyclic tree, where the vertices (Nodes) maintain any complex relationship among them instead of having parent child relationship.

        <h4 class="non-linear2">Hashing</h4>
        <div class="list">Hashing is the process of converting a given key into another value. A hash function is used to generate the new value according to a mathematical algorithm. The result of a hash function is known as a hash value or simply, a hash.
            good hash function uses a one-way hashing algorithm, or in other words, the hash cannot be converted back into the original key.
